# Kelly's Game

## Notes for self:
- Does Kelly know about the AI?
- Does Kelly have contact to other people?
- Maybe the AI is like a Alexa type thing. It could notify her about events happening in Day 1 in particular.
- Would be dramatically interesting if it refused to answer sometimes. Maybe Kelly is already used to that.
- What is her initial goal for getting the computer? Maybe sth she read? Maybe looking for people?
- Gameplay needs to be made fun somehow...
- How tf does internet work? She could steal it from the assistant huh
- Commands: ls, cd, cat, touch, ping, kill, echo, exec, ssh, netcat?, talk, alias?, top?, sudo?
- Could do some for fun, like sl or cowsay

## Day 1
### Goals
#### Gameplay:
- teach player to navigate Kelly's room
- teach player to use the terminal (cd, ls, cat, ping?)
#### Story:
- characterise Kelly
- expose just enough of the world to get the player interested
- attach the player to muffin

### Plot
- Kelly is woken up by the AI, telling her the goals for the day (watering plants, playing with the cat, "free time", will receive package)
- Kelly goes about her day, watering her plants and playing with Muffin
- She reads a book about the past? (Exposition also familiarize player with book controls)
- Kelly receives vintage computer with manual
- Kelly reads the manual and tries basic commands.
- The shell crashes when she tries to access the internet (pings facebook?).
- She gets the option to file a support ticket. She does and puts the computer to sleep.
- Plays with muffin again. Muffin doesn't really want to, they are tired.
- Kelly goes to sleep with Muffin sleeping on her stomach. Game fades to black with purring noises.

## Day 2
### Goals
#### Gameplay:
- learn how to interact with chad
- delve deeper into shell commands (touch, echo >?, ssh?, talk!)

### Plot
