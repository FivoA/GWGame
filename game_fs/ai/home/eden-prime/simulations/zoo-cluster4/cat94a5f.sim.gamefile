Simulation Report: Simple Animal Model - 2063-12-04

Sim ID: 2047-ANML-0932
Status: SUCCESSFUL
Project: Eden Prime
---
Animal Profile:
- Name: Muffin
- Species: Domestic Cat
- Age: 4 years
- Behavioral Complexity: Average

Daily Activity:
- Sleep: 16 hours
  - Notes: Deep and undisturbed, typical feline rest pattern
- Exploration: 3 hours
  - Notes: Wandering simulated environment, curiosity-driven
- Grooming: 2 hours
  - Notes: Regular self-maintenance behavior
- Interaction: 1 hour
  - Notes: Engaged with virtual human handler simulation

Health Metrics:
- Vital Signs: Stable
- Stress Levels: None detected
- Cognitive Activity: Low but within normal feline parameters, minimal lonely

Simulation Notes:
Muffin the cat demonstrates expected feline behavior patterns with high stability and low system resource usage. 
The simulation environment remains optimal for simple animal models.

Next Steps:
- Maintain observation for extended stability verification.
- Possible introduction of environmental variations for behavioral response testing.
- Induce human interaction with new human interaction model for better human simulation behaviour pattern
