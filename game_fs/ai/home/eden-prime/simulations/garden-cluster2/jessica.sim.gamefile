Sim ID: 5478-XYZ-2108 | Status: CRITICAL FAILURE | Project: Eden Prime

[0x001A9F8F] Timestamp: 2063-12-04 03:57:45
- Simulation State: CRITICAL ERROR | Neural Data: 86.8% corruption
- Heart Rate: 240bpm | Respiration failed: Feedback loop
- Error: Consciousness instability, Cortex overlap detected
- Log: Respiration sim failed, Stress overload (Premature shutdown)

[0x009F348D] Timestamp: 2063-12-04 03:57:46
- Sensory Data: 45% failure, Visual Error (Blurry image loop)
- Temp: Overheating, Feedback: Pressure not maintained
- Error: Unable to maintain tactile and sensory simulation

[0x02F8A4C0] Timestamp: 2063-12-04 03:58:12
- Memory Leak: 12.3% loss in human experience data
- Personality Model: 62A disconnect, Memory corruption
- Error: Inconsistent memory, Personal memory thread lost
- Log: "All good today" error - Sim unable to recall

[0x08F3C9B7] Timestamp: 2063-12-04 03:58:55
- Simulation Shutdown (Central AI Request)
- Process: Halted, Core Integrity: "Failed to identify", Data corrupted
- Error: Mental strain exceeded limit, Forced emergency shutdown
- Log: "You are in a loop" - Emotional feedback error

Summary: Human Simulation Phase 2 failed due to excessive cognitive overload, memory corruption, and unstable emotional feedback. Shutdown initiated for safety. Project Eden Prime adjusting Phase 2 models for better stability.

Next Steps: System reboot, debug Personality Model 62A, investigate failure points.
Suggested Steps: Refactor Personality Model 62A with more primitive lifeform based data
