Simulation Notes:
The simple human model performed as expected with a steady, predictable routine. No deviations from the planned behaviors. All vital signs and activities tracked within optimal ranges. The simulation is progressing as intended.

Next Steps:
Continue observation of this basic model
Gradual introduction of additional complexity in future simulations
Observe interaction with non simulated humans for simulation model improvements
